##High Concept
It's almost like agar.io, but it's not! Instead you chuck circles at the other player until they shrink away!

##Genre
Sliiiight bullet hell/ avoidance / shooter.

##Platform
Desktop

##Story
Two orbs just really hate eachother. They decide to throw smaller orbs at the other until eventually one of them disappears.
May the best circle win!

##Aesthetics
Simple, brightly colored orbs will represent the player and their bullets. Sound effects will be soft but impactful. There will be sound
for hits, healing, and obtaing orbs.
