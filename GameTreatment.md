## High Concept
It's almost like agar.io, but it's not! Instead you chuck circles at the other player until they shrink away!

## Genre
Sliiiight bullet hell/ avoidance / shooter.

## Platform
Desktop

## Story
Two orbs just really hate eachother. They decide to throw smaller orbs at the other until eventually one of them disappears.
May the best circle win!

## Aesthetics
Simple, brightly colored orbs will represent the player and their bullets. Sound effects will be soft but impactful. There will be sound
for hits, healing, and obtaing orbs. 

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
Players collect orbs from the center and shoot them at eachother in an attempt to make the other player disappear. They have the option to use an orb for healing instead of ammo after a certain amount of time, helping the player restore their size. When a player attacks another
player, they'll start to shrink.

### Control
WASD for player one for movement. Left shift to shoot. Z to heal.
Arrow Keys for player two for movement. Right shift to shoot. ? to heal.

### Teaching the game/New user experience
Instructions will appear on screen for about two shots between the players so that they understand how the controlls work. The instructions show how each player can move, shoot, or heal. Players will quickly learn the controls while competeing against other players.
