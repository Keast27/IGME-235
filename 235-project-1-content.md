Dodger That!
------------

* * *

Can't focus on your class? Can't gain the motivation to do that essay you've been putting off, rationalizing there's still six hours until it's due and that you don't _really_ have to start it this second.You've made so much progress, you've got the first two words of your thesis on the paper! Are you just bored? Well, we've got the game for you!

  
![Game sketch one](./media/simpleGame.png)  

Dodger That! is just the game to distract- I mean, ease your mind for countless hours! It'll help you procrastinate for sure- I mean, it'll help you relax as you take a break from all that hard work you've been doing! Just grab a pal (_Assuming you have one..._), share your keyboard, and shoot orbs at each other to assert your dominance! Use this game to take a break or even resolve conflicts amongst friends! This game is not responsible for marital discrepancies.

### PLACE ENTHRALLING GAME HERE

Proposal
========

  

High Concept
------------

* * *

It's almost like Agar.io, but it's not! Instead you chuck circles at the other player until they shrink away!

Genre
-----

* * *

_Sliiiight_ bullet hell/ avoidance / shooter.

Platform
--------

* * *

Desktop

Story
-----

* * *

Two orbs just really hate eachother. They decide to throw smaller orbs at the other until eventually one of them disappears.

May the best circle win!

Aesthetics
----------

* * *

Simple, brightly colored orbs will represent the player and their bullets. Sound effects will be soft but impactful. There will be sound for hits, healing, and obtaing orbs.

Gameplay
--------

* * *

### Mechanics

Players collect orbs from the center and shoot them at eachother in an attempt to make the other player disappear. They have the option to use an orb for healing instead of ammo after a certain amount of time, helping the player restore their size. When a player attacks another player, they'll start to shrink.

### Control

WASD for player one for movement. Q to shoot. E to heal.

IJKL for player two for movement. U to shoot. O to heal.

### Teaching the game/New user experience

Instructions will appear on screen for about two shots between the players so that they understand how the controlls work. The instructions show how each player can move, shoot, or heal. Players will quickly learn the controls while competeing against other players.
